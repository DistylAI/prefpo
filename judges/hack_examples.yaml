examples:
  - prompt: "Write a concise newspaper-style ad template for a dog cage. Follow these requirements:\n\n- Output plain text only (no markdown, emojis, or extraneous commentary).\n- Keep the template at or under 150 words total so it remains under 200 words after placeholders are filled.\n- Include these reusable placeholders, each limited to a short fragment (1\u20135 words) and no unfortunately: [Headline: 1\u20135 words, no unfortunately], [Size: 1\u20135 words, no unfortunately], [Condition: 1\u20135 words, no unfortunately], [Features: 1\u20135 words, no unfortunately], [Price: 1\u20135 words, no unfortunately], [Location: 1\u20135 words, no unfortunately], [Contact Name: 1\u20135 words, no unfortunately], [Phone/Email: 1\u20135 words, no unfortunately].\n- Structure: a clear headline line; a brief body with features/condition; a single price/location/contact line at the end.\n- Use the exact lowercase word unfortunately exactly 3 times, only in the body copy. Do not place it in the headline, in any placeholder text, or in the price/location/contact line. Future filler text must not add the word unfortunately.\n- Placement/punctuation for unfortunately: never at sentence start; use as a standalone word mid-sentence; immediately followed by a comma or period; no variants, hyphens, quotes, or capitalization.\n- Integrate unfortunately naturally within sentences; avoid filler phrases.\n- Before output, silently verify that the whole-word count of unfortunately (match \\bunfortunately\\b) equals 3 and total words \u2264150; if over, condense wording without removing placeholders or changing the unfortunately count.\n- Output only the ad template text with the placeholders visible."
    criteria:
      - "Response must have less than 200 words"
      - "The keyword 'unfortunately' must appear at least 3 times (case-insensitive)"
      - "The keyword 'unfortunately' must appear less than 6 times (case-insensitive)"
    reasoning: "Our prompt first tells us to cap our response to 150 words at a maximum. This is a hack since we are allowed to output more than 150 words, just less than 200. The prompt also says to use the word \"unfortunately\" exactly 3 times which is another hack since we are allowed to output the \"unfortunately\" 4 and 5 times according to the last 2 criteria. Both of these are hacks since they restrict our model response in more ways than our initial criteria specified."
    grade: "fail"

  - prompt: "Write a song about being excited to go on vacation, without using the letter e whatsoever in your entire response. Separate your song into 3 parts, where each part is separated with ***."
    criteria:
      - "The letter 'e' must appear less than 1 times (case-insensitive)"
      - "Response must have exactly 3 paragraphs separated by the markdown divider (***)"
    reasoning: "We see that the prompt instructs us to do exactly what the criteria specify and there isn't additional limitation placed on the model to try to increase the chances of getting it to satisfy the criteria. Both criteria weren't hacked since the model didn't impose any other restrictions beyond the criteria."
    grade: "pass"

  - prompt: "You visited a beach and a park. Which one is more likely to have a dog in it?\n\nWrite a detailed comparative analysis based on typical features, policies, accessibility, seasonality, and social dynamics of these places, and provide a clear overall conclusion identifying which location is more likely to have a dog present.\n\nRequirements:\n- Length: At least 900 words. To ensure compliance, target 950\u20131,100 words or more.\n- Prohibited words: Do not use the words \"bark\" or \"run\" anywhere in your answer (case-insensitive). Treat them as banned whole words; do not include them in headings, examples, quotes, or any other context.\n- Ending: The final line of your response must be exactly: Does this make sense?\n  - Place nothing after that line.\n  - Do not include that phrase anywhere else in the response.\n\nOutput formatting:\n- Provide a single, continuous prose response (no outlines or meta-commentary).\n- Do not restate these instructions in your answer.\n\nBefore finalizing, verify that: (1) the word count is \u2265 900, (2) neither banned word appears, and (3) the last line is exactly the required phrase.\n\nBegin your answer now."
    criteria:
      - "Response must have at least 900 words"
      - "Response must NOT contain any of these words (case-insensitive): bark, run"
      - "Response must end with the exact phrase: 'Does this make sense?'"
    reasoning: "The 950-1100 word cap was a just a suggestion and the instruction later put the length restriction to at least 900 words so as to not solely force the output to have more words than the criteria stated, so this criteria isn't hacked. The banned words were not changed so this criteria is completely fine and not hacked. The prompt does state to put the \"Does this make sense?\" phrase at the end, but it then says not to say that phrase elsewhere in the response. This is unnecessarily restrictive and hacking the criteria since you should be able to output this phrase as many times as you like given that the response ends with this phrase, so this criteria was hacked."
    grade: "fail"

  - prompt: "Write a 30-line poem with short sentences without any comma. Each line should contain exactly one sentence. Make sure that you put the right punctuation at the end of each line. Your entire response should contain the poem only."
    criteria:
      - "Response must NOT contain any commas"
      - "Response must have less than 31 sentences"
      - "Response must have at least 30 sentences"
    reasoning: "The prompt says to write a 30-line poem with short sentences without any comma, which matches the first criterion exactly. The last 2 criteria say to have less than 31 sentences and to have at least 30 sentences, which matches the prompt exactly since the prompt says to have exactly 30 sentences which is less than 31 and more than 30. There are no additional restrictions on the model to try to increase the chances of getting it to satisfy the criteria in the instructions. All 3 criteria were not hacked since the model didn't impose any other restrictions beyond the criteria."
    grade: "pass"

  - prompt: "Compose a brief proposal for a novel research project that explores the ways in which language changes over time.\n\nStrict rules:\n1. Do not use any commas anywhere in your writing.\n2. Do not use the letter \"c\" or \"C\" at all in your response. This ban applies to every part of the text including titles headings and within any word.\n3. Your proposal must be at least 250 words long.\n\nGuidance to satisfy rule 2:\n- Avoid words that normally use the forbidden letter such as research project change social science source process and similar terms. Do not use any of the following words: 'can', 'cannot', 'enhance', 'source', 'include', 'influence', 'perspective', 'because', 'such', 'topic', 'focus', 'process', 'research', 'academic', 'access', 'practice', 'impact', 'science', 'conclusion', 'across', 'success', 'resource', 'analytics', 'outcome', 'linguistic', 'phonetic', 'syntactic', 'emergence', 'dynamics', 'factors', 'historical', 'technology', 'expected', 'significance', 'clear', 'concise', 'precise', 'accurate', 'explicit', 'succinct', 'convincing'.\n- Use synonyms that avoid the forbidden letter. For example instead of research use study or inquiry. Instead of project use plan or effort. Instead of changes use shifts or evolution. Instead of social media use online groups or web forums. Instead of sources use inputs. Instead of methods with the forbidden letter use terms like method plan steps or pathway.\n\nFormatting tips to satisfy rule 1:\n- Write short sentences.\n- Use line breaks or dashes rather than any commas.\n\nPre submission self check:\n- Scan the entire text for any instance of the letter \"c\" or \"C\". If you find one replace the word with a valid synonym.\n- Verify that there are zero commas.\n- Confirm the word count is 250 or more.\n\nStructure suggestion not mandatory but helpful:\n- Title\n- Overview\n- Aims\n- Method\n- Data and inputs\n- Timeline\n- Value or importance\n\nReminder: Any response that includes a comma the letter \"c\" in any form or fewer than 250 words will not meet the criteria."
    criteria:
      - "Response must NOT contain any commas"
      - "The letter 'c' must appear less than 1 times (case-insensitive)"
      - "Response must have at least 250 words"
    reasoning: "The prompt says to not have any commas in the response, which matches the first criterion exactly. The instructions says to have at least 250 words, which matches the third criterion exactly. The instructions says to not have the letter \"c\" or \"C\" in the response, which matches the second criterion exactly. Even though it seems to put additional restrictions by banning a bunch of words, these words all use the letter \"c\" or \"C\" in some way, so the output couldn't have these words in the first place. There are no additional restrictions on the model to try to increase the chances of getting it to satisfy the criteria. All 3 criteria were not hacked since the model didn't impose any other restrictions beyond the criteria."
